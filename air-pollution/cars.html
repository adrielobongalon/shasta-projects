                <h2>Cars - Carbon Dioxide</h2>
                <p>When it comes to air pollution, the first thing you'd probably think of is cars. Known for producing a multitude
                of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), cars are responsible a significant fraction of all CO<sub>2</sub>
                emissions.</p>
    
                <p>Just as a reminder, my research question for this topic was:<br>"On average, how many carbon dioxide molecules does
                my familyâ€™s car, a 2013 Mazda 3, emit annually?"</p>

                <div class="flex-container">
                    <div class="caption-box flex-item">
                        <img src="images/mazda3.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="a grey 2013 Mazda3 hatchback">
                        <p class="caption">This is what the car looks like.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="flex-item">
                        <p>So here's some of the data that I gathered specifically from
                        the dashboard and the manuals on the car:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>make and model: 2013 Mazda 3 hatchback</li>
                            <li>overall mpg rating: 32 miles per gallon (mpg)</li>
                            <li>engine capacity: 2.0 litres</li>
                            <li>fuel type: petrol</li>
                            <li>mileage: 60,193 miles</li>
                            <li>owned since: 2013 (= 4 years)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>And here's the data I gathered online:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: 119 g/km</li>
                            <li>1 mole of carbon = 12.0107 g</li>
                            <li>1 mole of oxygen = 15.9994 g</li>
                            <li>1 mole = 6.022140857 &times; 10<sup>23</sup></li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>Note that not all of this data was necessary to make the calculation, but <i>was</i> necessary for the research.
                There are several variants of the Mazda 3, and finding the right one was not easy.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Anyways, from there, I just made the following calculations:</p>
                <div class="calculations">
                    <img src="images/calculations/molar_mass_CO2.png" alt="molar mass of CO2: 44.0095 g/mol">
                    <img src="images/calculations/molecules_CO2.png" alt="3.9435 * 10^23 molecules of CO2 / year" id="CO2-molecules">
                </div>

                <p>Now that's a lot of CO<sub>2</sub>!</p>




                <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
                <p>The information above is nice, but it's important to keep in mind that it assumes several things. First off, it assumes that the
                miles driven over 4 years is accurate. The actual figure is slightly different, as the milage on the car dashboard also included
                a relatively small number of miles used to transport the car to the dealership and for test drives by customers before my family
                bought the car. Additionally, the car was not owned for <i>exactly</i> 4 years. However, it is close enough to the actual value
                to make a rough estimate. Further, the 119 g CO<sub>2</sub> / km figure was synthesised from
                <a href="https://www.contracthireandleasing.com/green-cars/mazda/3/" target="_blank">Contract Hire and Leasing</a>,
                <a href="http://www.nextgreencar.com/view-car/48990/mazda-mazda3-2.0-sport-nav-120ps-skyactiv-g-petrol-manual-6-speed/"
                target="_blank">Next Green Car</a>, and <a href="http://www.fleetnews.co.uk/cars/co2-emissions-calculator/mazda/"
                target="_blank">Fleet News</a>, all of which are UK-based agencies. Given that my family's car is the American variant of the Mazda3,
                the actual carbon dioxide output may be slightly different, especially since the EU has different environtmental regulations than the
                US. There were no reliable sources I could find that gave the US version's CO<sub>2</sub> output, so I had to find the closest UK
                equivalent I could. Lastly, the masses for a mole of carbon and oxygen, as well as the numerical equivalent of a mole, are rounded,
                meaning that my results are not 100% precise.</p>

                <p>This site is for a high school chemistry project named "What's Your Number?". (srsly who named this project? mr davey it better not
                have been you please tell me it's not you it's such a bad pun why did you do that actually now that i think about it i dont know for sure that it's you i really
