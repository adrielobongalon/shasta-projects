                <h2>Power Plants - Sulfur Dioxide</h2>
                <p>Earlier while discussing cars, I mentioned making a switch to electric cars. If you've ever seen a climate change debate over
                that touched the subject of electric cars, you've probably heard someone say that although electric cars don't pollute the air very
                much, the power plants that provide their electric power do. "Electricity-powered cars," they contend, "are really coal-powered
                cars". Of course, this argument ignores the fact that not all electricity is generated by coal power plants, as well as the
                ridiculous amount of electricity required to refine enough fuel to power an equilalevnt gas-powered car, but I disgress.</p>

                <p>In any case, electricity-producing power plants remain responsible for a significant portion of the earth's air pollution. And
                while we've been making some progress towards using clean, renewable sources of electricity, there still are many types of power
                plants that produce different types of emissions. One particularly harmful type is the coal-based one. Not only do they release
                carbon dioxide into the air, but they also output other greenhouse gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>).</p>

                <p>For this section of my project, I decided to look at how much sulfur is output by the coal-powered plant nearest to me (in San
                Francisco). Specifically, I want to know how many grams of sulfur are in the sulfur dioxide it produces annually. Because sulfur
                dioxide is made of both sulfur <i>and</i> oxygen, when I make my calculations, I will need to account for this.</p>

                <div style="margin: 10px 0;">
                    <div class="caption-box img-border" style="width: 40%; float: right;">
                        <img src="images/power_plant.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="the power plant">
                        <p class="caption">The Port of Stockton District Energy Facility</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>The first order of business was to locate the nearest coal power plant. This took quite some effort to find, as there are a
                    lot of power plants in the United States alone. Luckily, the
                    <a href="http://www2.cec.org/site/PPE/so2emissions?page=3&order=field_plant_state_value&sort=asc" target="_blank">Commission for
                    Environmental Cooperation (CEC)</a> keeps a list of all registered power plants in the US, Canada, and Mexico, as well as their
                    annual emissions for different greenhouse gases, including sulfur dioxide. According to them, there are a lot of power plants in
                    California, but only 6 of them use coal as their main power source. The closest one to San Francisco is the Port of Stockton
                    District Energy Facility, which annually outputs 116.85 metric tonnes of SO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

                    <p>Then, I needed to look up the molar masses of sulfur and oxygen, which, according to the
                    <a href="http://abcdefghijklmn-pqrstuvwxyz.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/O_AlexandreSerrano_TablaPeriodica_9.jpg"
                    target="_blank">Periodic Table</a>, are 32.065 g&nbsp;/&nbsp;mol&nbsp;S and 15.9994 g&nbsp;/&nbsp;mol&nbsp;O.</p>
                </div>

                <p style="clear: right;">And finally, I did the calculations:</p>

                <div class="calculations">
                    <img src="images/calculations/moles_SO2.png" alt="molar mass of SO2: 64.0638 g/mol">
                    <img src="images/calculations/mass_SO2.png" alt="58,485,373.1749 g S / year">
                </div>




                <h2>Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
                <p>There are some limitations to this estimate. For one thing, the
                <a href="http://www3.cec.org/islandora/en/item/10236-north-american-power-plant-air-emissions" target="_blank">CEC Report</a> states
                that the information is based on information collected in 2002, roughtly 15 years ago. As such, this information is very likely
                outdated. However, it is the only reliable source I could find that listed all power plants in my vicinity, so it is basically as
                close as I can get. Another issue that this only accounts for the sulfur from the SO<sub>2</sub>. Although it sufficiently answers my
                research question sufficiently, a typical person would be more likely to ask how much sulfur comes from the power plant in general.
                This would require additional research and would be much more difficult to accurately estimate. Finally, the values I used for the
                molar masses of sulfur and oxygen are rounded, so this will mathematically affect my calculations by a relatively small amount.</p>
