                <h2>Cows - Methane</h2>
                <div class="caption-box img-border" style="width: 40%; float: left;">
                    <img src="images/cow.jpg" style="width: 100%;" alt="a cow">
                    <p class="caption">Moo.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Cows. Yes, Cows. Cattle. Those farm animals that go "moo". You might not believe me, but they are actually a
                major source of air pollution.</p>

                <p>You see, with a huge populations comes a huge demand for beef (and milk). And in order to get all that beef, we need to raise a
                lot of cattle and make sure they grow big. To increase farming efficiency, we feed them a certain type of grass, but they aren't able
                to fully digest it. It ferments in their stomachs, producing gas that they release into the atmosphere by burping. The problem is
                that one of those gases is methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), a greenhouse gas.</p>
                
                <p>So to answer my initial question of how many litres of methane get released by cows in the US every year, I needed to research how
                much and how often cows release methane, as well as the number of cows in the US. According to
                <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/methane-cow.htm" target="_blank">How Stuff Works</a>, experts estimate that a
                single dairy cow expels between 100 and 500 litres of methane per day, an "amount comparable to the pollution produced by a car". And
                according to the <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Cattle/inv.php" target="_blank">National Agricultural Statistics
                Service</a> from the US Department of Agriculture, as of January 1, 2016, the US Cattle Inventory included 91,988,000 cattle.
    
                <p style="margin-top: 40px;">And from there, it was just maths. Now keep in mind that since I was given a range for the methane
                output of a cow, I made seperate calculations for both the low end and the high end.</p>

                <div class="calculations">
                    <img src="images/calculations/low-end_CH4.png" alt="3,359,789,949,360 litres of CH4 / year" style="width: 75%;">
                    <img src="images/calculations/high-end_CH4.png" alt="16,798,949,746,800 litres of CH4 / year" style="margin-top: 70px; width: 75%;">
                </div>

                <p>So annually, cows from the US produce somewhere between roughly 3 and 17 trillion litres of methane. The "per US" unit might seem
                a little bit awkward, but it was necessary because of the conversion factors. Since there is only one United States of America, the
                unit can essentially be thought of as just "litres per year".</p>




                <h2 style="margin-top: 100px;">Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
                <p>There are a multitude of issues with this answer. First of all, it assumes that the number of cows in the US remain the same. It
                also assumes that each cow produces a constant amount of methane. Obviously, the number of cows is likely to fluctuate, and diffrent
                cows will produce different amount of methane. Further, what classifies as a "cow" affects the number. The USDA figure I used in my
                calculation includes "beef cows, milk cows, bulls, replacement heifers, other steers and heifers, and .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. calves",
                according to the <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Surveys/Guide_to_NASS_Surveys/Cattle_Inventory/" target="_blank">Guide to NASS
                Surveys</a>. Whether animals such as bulls are considered cows may be up for debate, and for those who think they are not, a
                different figure would be necessary do make the calculations. Further, the figures are rounded, so this would mathematically skew the
                figures by a relatively small amount.</p>

                <p>Most importantly, it should be noted that measuring gases in terms of volume doesn't really tell us anything about it because
                gases can always be compressed or expanded by changing the size of their containers. For example, a kilogram of methane can take up
                the space of an entire house, but it can also be compressed in a container into the size of a small box. Because of this, whenever
                gases are given in units of volume (instead of mass), it is important to include additional information such as the pressure or the
                temperature.</p>
                
                <p>The "100 to 500 letres per day" statistic came from
                <a href="http://animals.howstuffworks.com/mammals/methane-cow.htm" target="_blank">How Stuff Works</a>, which seems to have
                synthesised the statistic from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jul/10/ruralaffairs.climatechange"
                target="_blank">The Guardian</a> (which reports between 100 and 200 litres) and some other source that I was unable to trace back to.
                I looked through all the references the author listed, but was unable to find the 500 litre statistic, although this may be because
                many of the sources are no longer available at the original source location nor the Wayback Machine Internet Archive. In any case,
                none of the sources that listed the daily methane output in terms of volume specified any temperature or pressure, so it remains
                unclear as to exactly how much methane exists within each unit of volume. The only figures in units of mass I was able to locate was
                <a href="http://timeforchange.org/are-cows-cause-of-global-warming-meat-methane-CO2" target="_blank">between 70 and 120 kg per
                year</a>, but the reliability of the source is questionable. Thus, I had to do what I could with the information I had.</p>

                <p>Summarily, this estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, and it isn't in a particularly useful unit of measurement.</p>
